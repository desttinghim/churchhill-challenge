# Churchhill Challenge

This is still a *WIP*. The challenge is to create a fast range query. I've tried a couple of things so far:

* Naive array iteration. Works fine for small data sets, but the challenge targets a million points
* A kdtree. Takes too long to construct, and doesn't out perform the reference

I still have a couple of data structures I want to test out. It's taking a bit because I get tired from my work, but I do plan to have something fast by the end.
